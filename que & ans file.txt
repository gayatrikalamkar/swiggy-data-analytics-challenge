Answer the following Questions in 1to 2 lines .
 
● Question 1: What is Pandas, and why is it commonly used in data cleaning tasks?

:- Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It's commonly used in data cleaning due to its powerful tools for handling missing data, reshaping datasets, and transforming data efficiently.

 ● Question 2: Given a DataFrame with missing values, how would you check for missing values in each column and count the total number of missing values?

:-  # To check missing values in each column
       df. isnull().sum()
  # To check total count of missing values in DataFrame
     df.isnull().sum().sum()

 ● Question 3: How can you remove duplicates from a DataFrame while retaining the first occurrence of each unique row?

:-  # To Remove duplicates, retaining the first occurrence
     df.drop_duplicates(keep='first', inplace=True)

 ● Question 4: If you have a DataFrame with a column containing string values, how can you convert all the values in that column to lowercase? 

:-  # Convert column 'column_name' to lowercase
    df['column_name'] = df['column_name'].str.lower()

● Question 5: How do you replace missing values in a DataFrame with a specific value, like 0, for a particular column? 

:-  # To Replace missing values in 'column_name' with 0
      df['column_name'].fillna(0, inplace=True)

● Question 6: If you have a DataFrame with a datetime column, how can you extract the year, month, and day into separate columns?

:-  # To  Extract year, month, and day into separate columns
   df['Year'] = df['date_column'].dt.year
   df['Month'] = df['date_column'].dt.month
   df['Day'] = df['date_column'].dt.day

  ● Question 7: How can you filter rows in a DataFrame where a specific column's values meet a certain condition (e.g., all rows where 'age' is greater than 30)?
 
:- # To Filter rows where 'age' column is greater than 30
      filtered_df = df.query('age > 30')  

● Question 8: What is the purpose of the .apply() function in Pandas, and how would you use it to create a new column based on values from existing columns? 

:-   # To Create a new column 'new_column' using assign() method
      df = df.assign(new_column = df['column1'] * df['column2'])

● Question 9: Suppose you want to merge two DataFrames, 'df1' and 'df2,' on a common column 'key.' How would you perform this merge operation in Pandas? 

:-  # To Merge df1 and df2 on 'key' column
     merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='key')

● Question 10: You have a DataFrame with a column containing messy text data. How can you clean and standardize the text data (e.g., remove punctuation and convert to lowercase) in that column?

:-  # To Clean text column: remove punctuation and convert to lowercase
       df['text_column'] = df['text_column'].str.replace('[^\w\s]', '').str.lower()
